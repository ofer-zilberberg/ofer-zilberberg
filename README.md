Hi, my name is Ofer Zilberberg and i am an electrical Eng. lately i have started my way with Arduino, ARM, and MSP430 to construct some gadgets for fun.
I will publish any interesting projects i will do for the benefit of the community, and hopefully other will improve it, so i will gain also from this.
